This scheduler can send outbound SMS at regular intervals, using a web-based cron-inspired interface.

INSTALL
* Apart from enabling this feature, be sure that your system clock is correct and that your settings.py properly specifies the TIME_ZONE as per Django convention (or you're going to be super confused about why everything's coming in in Chicago time)

FEATURE REQUESTS
* There is currently no good UI for creating schedules. Right now, the easiest way to do so is in Python, 
by creating and saving an EventSchedule module.
